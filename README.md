# MusicAlbums

For this project I implemented a Multi Client–Server application using the TCP protocol where the user continuously inputs the name of an artist and the server replies with the number of albums for that particular artist, until the user types ‘stop’. The SQL query is a simple inner join executed on the Music database. I have 2 SQL files called music_create.sql and music_data.sql which were used to create a 'Musics' database that I connected to.
